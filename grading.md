Your individual contribution will be evaluated through peer assessment.  
This evaluation will be used as a "scaling factor" for your overall score.

If you are attempting something different, especially something that you think do not fit naturally into the grading scheme, feel free to discuss with your Lab TA directly. They will mentor you and also grade your project.
